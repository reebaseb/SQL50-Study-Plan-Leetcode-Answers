A focused collection of 50 solved SQL problems from LeetCode with clear explanations and annotated queries — curated for a 1-month interview preparation plan. This repo is ideal for beginners and those at an intermediate level wanting to solidify SQL fundamentals and common interview patterns.

Why this repo?
- Concise, well-explained answers for 50 common interview-style SQL problems.
- Problems organized to teach important SQL patterns and techniques.
- A practical 30-day study plan so you can prepare efficiently.

Contents
- Each problem lives in the `questions/` directory with:
  - a numbered folder: `01-two-sum-sql`
  - `README.md` inside each folder with the problem statement, approach, and final query
  - an optional `solution.sql` file with the canonical SQL
- `README.md` (this file)
- `LICENSE` (MIT)

Topics covered (examples)
- Filtering, aggregation, GROUP BY, HAVING
- JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) and self-joins
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, LEAD, LAG)
- Subqueries (correlated and uncorrelated)
- DISTINCT, EXISTS, IN, UNION
- Date/time operations and string functions
- Pattern matching and CASE expressions

Quick start
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/<your-org-or-username>/<repo-name>.git
2. Open the `questions/` directory and pick a problem.
3. Read the problem README, try it yourself, then compare with `solution.sql`.

30-Day Study Plan (suggested)
- Week 1 (Days 1–7): Basics — SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, DISTINCT, simple aggregations
- Week 2 (Days 8–14): GROUP BY, HAVING, intermediate aggregations, multi-table JOINs
- Week 3 (Days 15–21): Window functions, ranking, running totals, lead/lag
- Week 4 (Days 22–28): Complex joins, subqueries, correlated subqueries, UNIONs
- Final days (Days 29–30): Review tough problems, timed practice, and mock interviews

Study tips
- Attempt the problem first without looking at the answer.
- Explain your approach out loud or write it down before coding.
- Timebox practice (30–45 minutes per problem) to simulate interview pressure.
- Focus on clean, readable queries and add comments where helpful.
- Revisit previously solved problems weekly.
